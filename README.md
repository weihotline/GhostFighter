## Welcome to GhostFighter
This is a simple flash game that I developed for fun. Flash might be dead when Steve Jobs announced that mobile platform would no longer support flash. Well, my ghost fighter game still exists and let's enjoy it. (Programming is fun no matter what language you use.)

## Live Demo
